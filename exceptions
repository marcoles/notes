If execution of the try block completes abruptly for any other reason R, then the finally block is executed, and then there is a choice.

If the finally block completes normally, then the try statement completes abruptly for reason R.

If the finally block completes abruptly for reason S, then the try statement completes abruptly for reason S (and reason R is discarded).
